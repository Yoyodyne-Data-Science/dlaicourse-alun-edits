    "In the previous exercise you saw how to create a neural network that figured out the problem you were trying to solve. This gave an explicit example of learned behavior. Of course, in that instance, it was a bit of overkill because it would have been easier to write the function Y=2x-1 directly, instead of bothering with using Machine Learning to learn the relationship between X and Y for a fixed set of values, and extending that for all values.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about a scenario where writing rules like that is much more difficult -- for example a computer vision problem? Let's take a look at a scenario where we can recognize different items of clothing, trained from a dataset containing 10 different types."

    "Earlier when you trained for extra epochs you had an issue where your loss might change. It might have taken a bit of time for you to wait for the training to do that, and you might have thought 'wouldn't it be nice if I could stop the training when I reach a desired value?' -- i.e. 95% accuracy might be enough for you, and if you reach that after 3 epochs, why sit around waiting for it to finish a lot more epochs....So how would you fix that? Like any other program...you have callbacks! Let's see them in action..."
